# Object Detection Model (Trash Detector)

## Now that we have built image classification models in the [`PyTorch-Bootcamp`](https://github.com/purplelord2003/PyTorch-Bootcamp) repository, I will now be attempting to build an Object Detection Model using PyTorch. This model will attempt to detect trash objects in images.

### This repository contains all the work I have done in the 2 Jupyter Notebooks in the `Jupyter Notebooks` folder. The `Demo preparation` folder contains the zip file that was then uploaded to Hugging Face spaces. You can access the built model demo application at https://huggingface.co/spaces/purplelord2003/Trash_Object_Detector.
